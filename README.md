# Primero Localized

UNICEF is extending its hosted Primero service to deliver "Primero Tier 4", a hybrid cloud package of services for operating Primero. This delegates the responsibility for managing the physical infrastructure to local country teams while keeping the responsibility for managing and operating Primero services with UNICEF.

This repository contains documentation and tools that a local team can use to build a server that can be integrated with Primero Tier 4. We will refer to this server as "Localized Primero."

This documentation contains the following sections:
- [Preparing your server for connection to Primero](docs/remote-onboarding-pipeline.md)
- [Security hardening](docs/security.md)
- [Day-to-day operations](docs/oprations.md)
- [A sample approach for Primero database backups](docs/backup.md)

## Contributing

Local teams may wish to share their experience with setting up Localized Primero servers. The Primero Team welcomes their input. We will work to incorporate proposed best practices for Localized Primero server configuration into this guide.
